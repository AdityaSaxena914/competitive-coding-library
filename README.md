## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AdityaSaxena914/competitive-coding-library.git
cd competitive-coding-library
```

### 2️⃣ Use a Snippet or Template
- **C++ Fast I/O Snippet** → `snippets/fast_io.cpp`
- **Binary Search Template** → `templates/searching/binary_search.h`
- **Include all algorithms** → `#include "templates/competitive.h"`

### 3️⃣ Run a Test Case
```bash
g++ templates/searching/binary_search.h -o binary_search  
./binary_search < test_cases/sample_input.txt  
```
